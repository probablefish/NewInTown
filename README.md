# NewInTown
An Android app which gives you data about your local area including crime and nearest coffee shops.

Still many more features to be added, including next trains in/out of town, best restaurants, nearest parks, local MP etc.

The crime feature only works in the UK.

If you want to use this, you will have to get API Keys from Google and Foursquare. These should then be added to your _gradle.properties_ file with the following property names:

*GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
*FOURSQUARE_CLIENT_ID
*FOURSQUARE_CLIENT_SECRET
